# Robosub_Simulation
A Small Proof of Concept project to better understand the inner workings of ROS-Gazebo Integration
- All our developed code is located on the different branches for this repository. 
- the [actual_working](https://github.com/GonzagaRobotics/Robosub_Simulation/tree/actual_working) branch contains code for running of a Gazebo 1 simulation of a moving cube
- the [camera](https://github.com/GonzagaRobotics/Robosub_Simulation/tree/camera) branch contains code for running the camera in a Gazebo simulation
